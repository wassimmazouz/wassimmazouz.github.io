Extended the Wave Function Collapse algorithm beyond image synthesis by integrating a learned discrete latent space from a Vector-Quantized VAE.  
Compressed complex visual patterns into symbolic tokens to enable faster constraint propagation and more expressive pattern generation.  
Demonstrated improved diversity and structure preservation on large-scale datasets, bridging procedural generation with deep representation learning.
