Modified and extended Karpathy’s original *nanochat* project to explore how minimal transformer architectures can support conversational fine-tuning.  
Enhanced data preprocessing and tokenization for multi-turn dialogue while optimizing training stability and memory efficiency.  
Integrated lightweight evaluation and sampling modules to visualize emergent conversation coherence, bridging interpretability with compact transformer design.
