Implemented a bio-inspired optimization algorithm to solve complex routing problems using the collective intelligence of virtual “ants.”  
The model balances exploration and exploitation to converge toward near-optimal paths in dynamic environments, simulating pheromone evaporation and reinforcement.  
Achieved efficient route convergence and visualized adaptive swarm behavior across multiple graph topologies.
