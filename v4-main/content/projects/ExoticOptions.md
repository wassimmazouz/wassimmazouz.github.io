Developed a pricing engine for exotic options — including lookback, Asian, and barrier options — under combined stochastic volatility and stochastic interest rate dynamics.  
Implemented and optimized Monte Carlo simulations to enhance convergence speed across multiple model configurations.  
Calibrated the Heston–Hull–White parameters using real CAC40 and EURIBOR data, improving pricing stability and validating theoretical consistency with empirical observations.
