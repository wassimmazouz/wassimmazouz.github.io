Recreated the 2048 puzzle in C++ with a clean, testable core engine separating game state, move compression/merging, and scoring.  
Implements deterministic RNG seeding for reproducible runs, undo support, and a lightweight terminal UI.  
Focused on performance and clarity of the merge algorithm, with unit tests covering edge cases (chains, no-move states, and spawn logic).
