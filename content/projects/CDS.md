Developed a comparative framework for pricing Credit Default Swaps using both structural and intensity-based models.  
Implemented Merton-type models and Cox processes to capture default dynamics under different credit environments.  
Performed Monte Carlo simulations to analyze sensitivity to parameters such as default intensity, recovery rate, and volatility, highlighting the trade-offs between model interpretability and calibration accuracy.
