Contributed to the open-source Benchopt framework to enhance large-scale optimization benchmarking for machine learning models.  
Improved cross-platform compatibility (including Windows) and added new features for reproducibility and performance tracking.  
Collaborated with international researchers during the June 2024 coding sprint, leading to the integration of the new modules into the main repository.
